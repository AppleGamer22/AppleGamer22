# picoCTF 2021 [Wave a flag](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/170)
## Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [This program](warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...
```
$ chmod +x warm 
$ ./warm
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
$  ./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}
